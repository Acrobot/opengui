{"name":"OpenGUI","tagline":"Open source GUI framework for Unity","body":"### What is it?\r\nIt's a versatile and super simple GUI framework for Unity.\r\nIt takes advantage of the native GUI classes, but allows you to work with it in edit mode and to some extent with 3D objects as well.\r\nIt's still in its early stages, but I consider it ready for a beta release.\r\nI am developing this in tandem with my Deus Ex-based game project <a href=\"http://mrzapp.github.io/vongott/\">The Vongott Chronicles</a>\r\n\r\n### Version 1.0\r\nThe upcoming version of OpenGUI will deprecate the use of OnGUI draw calls and move towards the low-level GL API. It's well under way, but still in the works. If you want to test it out, check out the \"testing\" project in this repo.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- Drawing 2D & 3D GUI in edit mode (in game view)\r\n- Supports most regular widget types, plus a few odd ones\r\n- Super simple, no bloat\r\n- Sensibly managed and easy to use\r\n- Built-in page manager\r\n- Implements <a hreaf=\"http://itween.pixelplacement.com/index.php\">iTween</a> by Bob Berkebile\r\n- MouseOver detection\r\n- Free & Open Source!\r\n\r\n### License\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br /><span xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" property=\"dct:title\">OpenGUI</span> by <span xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" property=\"cc:attributionName\">mrzapp</span> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.<br />Based on a work at <a xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" href=\"https://github.com/mrzapp/opengui\" rel=\"dct:source\">https://github.com/mrzapp/opengui</a>.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
